Book: A Study in Scarlet

I realized that the file was a sqlite database when I opened it with the notepad and found the text "SQLite format 3"
I trusted on the validity of the data after I saw that the "words" had a reasonable length and none special characther was used frequently.
The final text is readable and coherent.

To use it, execute the run.bat file if you are using windows, otherwise execute the run.sh file.

By default the path of the database is ./book.db3 and and a resulting file will be written on ./book1.txt. For changing the default values explained previously change the execution files (run.*)

The jar can be used as third party library.
